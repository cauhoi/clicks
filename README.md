# Find Clicks

## Getting Started
To load the clicks array in solution.rb, make sure to set the variable as a constant CLICKS inside a Clicks module
You should install ruby and have the 'date' gem since we will need to parse the timestamp
After you run solution.rb it will generate result-set.txt


## Running the code
ruby solution.rb


## Running the tests
Make sure you have Rails install
the solution_test.rb should be in the unit test folder
run the code below
ruby -I test test/unit/solution_test.rb
